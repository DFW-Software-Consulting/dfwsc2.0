# DFWSC Frontend

React + Vite marketing site and onboarding UI.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default the app expects the API at `http://localhost:4242/api/v1` when running locally.

Set `VITE_API_URL` in `front/.env` if you want a different API base URL.

## Docker (served by nginx)

The production build is generated by `front/Dockerfile` and served by nginx.
Requests to `/api/*` are proxied to the `api` service defined in the root
`docker-compose.yml`.
