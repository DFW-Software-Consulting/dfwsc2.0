# DFWSC Frontend

React + Vite marketing site and onboarding UI.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default the app expects the API at `http://localhost:4242/api/v1` when running locally.

Set `VITE_API_URL` in `front/.env` if you want a different API base URL.

## Admin Dashboard Flow

The admin dashboard lives on the `/onboard` page alongside the client
token onboarding form.

1. Open `http://localhost:5173/onboard` (or `http://localhost:8080/onboard` in Docker dev).
2. Log in with `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` via `POST /api/v1/auth/login`.
3. The UI stores the JWT in `sessionStorage` as `adminToken` and uses it for:
   - `GET /api/v1/clients`
   - `POST /api/v1/accounts`
   - `PATCH /api/v1/clients/:id`
4. Log out to clear the stored token.

## Docker (served by nginx)

The production build is generated by `front/Dockerfile` and served by nginx.
Requests to `/api/*` are proxied to the `api` service defined in the root
`docker-compose.yml`.

## Docker (dev)

When using `docker-compose.dev.yml`, the Vite dev server runs on
`http://localhost:8080` and the onboarding UI is at `/onboard`.
